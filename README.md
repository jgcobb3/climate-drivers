Research Questions:
How do reported crop losses, specifically from drought, extreme precipitation, high heat, and frost or freeze, relate to concerns of USDA field staff over those climate or weather stressors?
How do observed extreme events, specifically drought, extreme precipitation, high heat, and frost or freeze, relate to concern of USDA field staff over those same climate or weather stressors?
Different time scales: 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 30 years? Number of years a respondent has worked for USDA might be a relevant model component here.

Course Abstract:
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) places thousands of field staff in county offices across the country to provide conservation technical assistance, low cost farm loans, and disaster recovery assistance to farmers and foresters through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). As climate change brings increasingly variable and extreme weather to farms, these field staff are poised to provide technical support to farmers who may be unsure of how to prepare for and respond to climate and weather threats. The USDA Climate Hubs were formed, in part, to provide management relevant scientific information to USDA field staff and others. However, significant variation exists among USDA field staff regarding perceptions of climate change and both general and specific risks (Wiener et al. 2018). Furthermore, in order to effectively prepare USDA field staff to provide assistance to American farmers impacted by climate change and extreme weather, we must understand how past events influence risk perception. These factors can inform how organizations such as the USDA Climate Hubs communicate with these key partners, provide trainings, and create professional development opportunities.

In this course, we will explore how reported crop losses and historical climate and weather events within a respondent’s state influence perceptions of climate and weather risk. Specifically, we will examine relationships with both observed occurrences of extreme events and of crop losses due to drought, extreme precipitation, high heat, and frost or freeze. Through this project, we will apply historical climate data, crop loss indemnity figures, and findings our team collected from a nation-wide survey of USDA field staff to the contemporary debate regarding the influence that personal experience has on individuals’ perceptions of risk. 

Paper Summary (written by MTN several months ago):
Paper 2: Disaster type experiences and their relationship to future risk concerns. Here we propose to do a more specific investigation of the TYPE of disaster- drought, flood ,etc. and see how it relates to Q_11, concern for future risk. We would ask a question like, “To what extent does past experience with a given disaster correlate with future concern for that kind of disaster? We’d be able to explore both the total number of times there was a given drought (for example, if there were 10 droughts in 4 years) as well as the magnitude of impact of that drought (1 drought, but huge losses). In this sense, I hope we can see whether there is a critical threshold at which experiencing either a certain number of disasters, or a level of magnitude might fundamentally shift perceptions.

Data Sources:
Data from two surveys targeted towards USDA FSA and NRCS field staff administered by our team between November 2016-March 2017. The FSA survey had 4,621 responses (43% response rate) and the NRCS survey had 1,893 responses (22% response rate). 
Four years of crop loss data at the state and county level from the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) and FSA (2013-2016). The two datasets together paint an accurate picture of acres lost and cost of loss, including data on cause of loss, and crop type. Potential for acquiring additional historical indemnity and loss data exists, pending approval from FSA. RMA data is publicly available dating back to the 1940s. 
State level data compiled from USDA, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and US Forest Service (USFS) detailing total number of acres in production for agriculture and livestock, including leased rangeland through BLM and the US Forest Service and crop-level data through USDA. These data are used to normalize the crop loss data at a state level.
Monthly gridded climate data at state and climate division level for temperature (min/max), precipitation, and drought (Palmer Drought Severity Index). These data go back to 1895, though we will focus on the last 30 years.

Agreement with statements:
It is important for producers to adapt to climate change to ensure the long-term success of US agriculture
Climate change is not a big issue because human ingenuity will enable producers to adapt to changes
I believe there is an increased need for FSA/NRCS programs in my service area due to changing weather patterns
In the past 5 years, I have noticed more variable/unusual weather in my area
To cope with increasing climate variability, changing farming practices is important for the long-term success of producers in my service area
Extreme weather events in recent years have affected the long-term management goals of producers in my service area
Changes in weather patterns are hurting the producers in my service area
Respondent state
